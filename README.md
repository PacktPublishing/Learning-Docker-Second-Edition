# Learning Docker - Second Edition
This is the code repository for [Learning Docker - Second Edition](https://www.packtpub.com/networking-and-servers/learning-docker-second-edition?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781786462923), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
Docker is an open source containerization engine that offers a simple and faster way for developing and running software. Docker containers wrap software in a complete filesystem that contains everything it needs to run, enabling any application to be run anywhere – this flexibily and portabily means that you can run apps in the cloud, on virtual machines, or on dedicated servers.

This book will give you a tour of the new features of Docker and help you get started with Docker by building and deploying a simple application. It will walk you through the commands required to manage Docker images and containers. You'll be shown how to download new images, run containers, list the containers running on the Docker host, and kill them.

You'll learn how to leverage Docker's volumes feature to share data between the Docker host and its containers – this data management feature is also useful for persistent data. This book also covers how to orchestrate containers using Docker compose, debug containers, and secure containers using the AppArmor and SELinux security modules.
## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
FROM busybox 
RUN ls -lh 
CMD echo Hello world 
```

You need Ubuntu 16.04 to run the examples covered in this book.
